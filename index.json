[{"content":"Installing Eversity is actually very easy!\nFor it you will need to have these things:\n School (or any other educational institution, really) that is connected to Schools.by platform A working server that supports OpenJDK 16 (In this tutorial private VPS with Ubuntu 20.04. 1 GB RAM, 1 CPU core was used) IP address, available from the internet with public domain (optional) ~2 GB of Internet traffic ~20 minutes of time  Got it? Then let\u0026rsquo;s start!\nInstallation Note: all commands from this tutorial are made for Ubuntu, but for any other platform whole proccess is roughly same\n1. Get OpenJDK 16 It is one of most simplest steps. Execute next commands in your terminal:\nsudo apt install -y openjdk-16-jre Now, check that everything installed properly:\njava -version It should output something like\nopenjdk version \u0026#34;16.0.2\u0026#34; 2021-07-20 OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 16.0.2+7-Ubuntu-2) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 16.0.2+7-Ubuntu-2, mixed mode, sharing) 2. Install and configure PostgreSQL Installation:\nsudo apt install -y postgresql-13 After everything installed, run this command to start database:\nsudo service postgresql start Then, drop into database shell:\nsudo -u postgres psql There, run next commands:\nCREATE USER eversity WITH PASSWORD \u0026#39;put your password here\u0026#39;; /* Creates user with username \u0026#39;eversity\u0026#39; and your password */ CREATE DATABASE eversity; /* Creates database named \u0026#39;eversity\u0026#39; */ GRANT ALL ON DATABASE eversity TO eversity; /* Grants all permissions on database to user \u0026#39;eversity\u0026#39; */ Cool! Now your server has eversity database! At this point, no additional settings are required.\n3. Get Eversity Server Actually, there are two ways to get Eversity Server:\n3.1 Build it by yourself There is nothing hard. First, obtain Eversity Server source code:\nsudo apt install -y git # ensures that git is intalled git clone https://github.com/enrollie/Eversity-Server.git cd Eversity-Server/ From there, build server:\nchmod +x ./gradlew # ensures that you can run gradlew ./gradlew shadowJar After build process ended, server JAR will be contained in build directory:\nbuild/libs/eversity-server-*.jar Copy it from there to previous directory and leave source code directory:\nmv build/libs/eversity-server-*.jar ../Eversity-Server.jar cd .. 3.2 Download prebuilt JAR Go to Eversity Server CircleCI, find last build job (top one), click on \u0026ldquo;build\u0026rdquo; Job, then click on \u0026ldquo;ARTIFACTS\u0026rdquo; tab and download Eversity Server\u0026rsquo;s JAR.\n4. Configure everything 4.1 Get School Naming config file Download \u0026ldquo;school_naming.properties.template\u0026rdquo; from this link. Rename it to \u0026ldquo;school_naming.properties\u0026rdquo; (remove \u0026lsquo;.template\u0026rsquo; part).\nOpen it and edit to fit your school (or other educational institution).\nPlease note, that this file needs to be contained in the same directory as Eversity Server JAR\n4.2 Get server config file Get application.conf from enrollie\u0026rsquo;s GitHub. Open it and make it fit to your needs.\n4.3 Create launch file Create file named \u0026ldquo;run.sh\u0026rdquo; (call it anything you like) and paste next contents into it:\n#!/bin/bash java -jar Eversity-Server.jar -config=application.conf Then, type next command into your terminal:\nchmod +x ./run.sh # Makes run.sh executable ./run.sh Now, if you done everything correctly, you should see something like\n Application started in 2.091 seconds\n If you see that, then congratulations! You\u0026rsquo;ve started your Eversity Server!\n","permalink":"Eversity-Docs/posts/installation/","summary":"Installing Eversity is actually very easy!\nFor it you will need to have these things:\n School (or any other educational institution, really) that is connected to Schools.by platform A working server that supports OpenJDK 16 (In this tutorial private VPS with Ubuntu 20.04. 1 GB RAM, 1 CPU core was used) IP address, available from the internet with public domain (optional) ~2 GB of Internet traffic ~20 minutes of time  Got it?","title":"Server installation"}]
